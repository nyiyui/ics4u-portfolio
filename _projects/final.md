Final project for my ICS4U course. This game, Survibee, follows the path of a bee that learns about how humans are hurting everyone by e.g. using pesticides.

The game has 3 levels, each named Learning, Testing, and Gaming. The first 2 teach the user about the issue, and the last is a pure action game-like level.
