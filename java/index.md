Welcome to my Java/OOP tutorial for my ICS4U0 (high school CS course) project.

You should also check out [purple-affogato's portfolio](https://purpleaffogatoicsportfolio.wordpress.com/)! The impeccable visual design leaves me `o(≧▽≦)O` (speechless)!

You can see the chapter list by clicking [Toggle Menu] or seeing the menu on the left-bottom.

Please learn `assert` statements. They raise an exception when the value is false:
```
assert false; // always raises exception
```

Sometimes, `/* ... */` will be used to show unrelated code removed for brevity.
